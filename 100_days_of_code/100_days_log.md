Day 1: Jan 10 (Example 1)
Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.
I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

Day 2: Jan 11 
I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

Day 3: Jan 12
Worked on my exercises from EECS 1710 and made some aesthetic changes.

Day 4: Jan 14
Tackled some technical issues with previous exercises (character physics, gravity,etc). These were the problems I couldn't solve at the time of submission in last sem due to lack of time.

Day 5: Jan 15
Started working on Lab Project 1. Developed some base ideas and learned coding for extension development.
